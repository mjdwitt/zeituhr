About

Zeituhr is a simple time-tracking app built by [Michael 
DeWitt](http://hackfoolery.com). Simply press the Start button, do work, hit 
Stop, and record what you worked on. Use the project code box to group tasks 
project or client and the memo box to record details about what you completed 
and what you need to do next.

Currently, all timer logs are kept locally on your computer, with no information 
being sent to the server. In the future, there will be an optional syncing 
service to aggregating your logs across multiple devices. Additional planned 
features include aggregating statistics, building simple invoices, and more.
