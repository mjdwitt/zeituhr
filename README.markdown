Zeituhr
=======

Zeituhr is a simple Angular app for logging time that aims to be as simple as 
`dongola7`'s [Time-Track-CLI](https://github.com/dongola7/Time-Track-CLI/) but 
a whole lot prettier. In its current version, it simply stores all logged time 
in localStorage. Perhaps I'll build another app for syncing data for registered 
users at some point in the future and extend this to use that. Who knows.

## Demo

I currently don't have Zeituhr up and running anywhere, so you'll have to build 
it yourself.

## Building

I'm building this with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), so after cloning 
this, you can just run `middleman` in the projects root directory and navigate 
to `localhost:4567` to see the results. Feel free to build it to static files 
with `middleman build` and host it yourself, if you'd rather.
